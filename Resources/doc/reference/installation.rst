Installation
============

Use composer to manage your dependencies and download SonatajQueryBundle:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require sonata-project/jquery-bundle

You'll be asked to type in a version constraint. 'dev-master' will usually get you the latest
version. Check `packagist <https://packagist.org/packages/sonata-project/jquery-bundle>`_
for older versions:

.. code-block:: bash

    Please provide a version constraint for the sonata-project/jquery-bundle requirement: dev-master
